## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has become ubiquitous, demonstrating the power of generating mesmerizing results of random portraits. However, users generally show greater interest in personalized information (for example, faces from familiar people or celebrities) in these generated results than in generic faces. This tendency toward customization in AIGC arouses attention to customized, personalized, and editable generative AI. 

This repo mainly focuses on visual generative models (leaving out LLMs), including 2D image-to-image, 2D text-to-image, and text-guided 3D generation/manipulation, collecting customized, personalized, and editable works in these specific domains. For any addition or bug about other domain 2D/3D AIGC, please open an issue, pull requests, or e-mail me at `normanzheng6606@gmail.com` for better communication.
